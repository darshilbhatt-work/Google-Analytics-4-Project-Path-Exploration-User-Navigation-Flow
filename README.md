# Google-Analytics-4-Project-Path-Exploration-User-Navigation-Flow

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Google Analytics 4 Path Exploration Report** so the main aim is to analyze the possible paths or events which user takes or how do Users navigate onto the website in order to figure out  patterns , behaviors etc. of the Users.  I have created two reports for this projects as I have mentioned 1 start point ( home page) and other ending point ( purchase event). The two reports helped me observe the movements or paths the User dwell upon and which turns they take which types of events they trigger and to be able to generate similar patterns eventually leading to be able to streamline Users and possibly analyze similar Cohorts.

**Disclaimer:** This project uses demo data; no real business data is involved.
